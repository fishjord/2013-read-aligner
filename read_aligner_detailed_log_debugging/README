The makefile and ipython notebook in this directory are designed to aid in
debugging paths explored by the read_aligner through the combined graph
structure.  This requires khmer be built with READ_ALIGNER_DEBUG (in 
lib/read_aligner.hh) be set to 1.

The results will be easiest to work with if you test with only one query,
even better if you test with only one path.  If you are running in to oom
errors you may also wish to do a ulimit before collecting the debug output
to reduce the total amount of data.
